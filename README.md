# Mobile Security Hash Generator

## Project scope
This little script is my first experiment using Go. I wrote it for my friend @marcotrumpet because he needed to calculate some file hashes for its security project.

Basically the program can encrypt and decrypt a file using AES-256.
It generates a random key at every encryption and it can export encrypted data/key also in Base64 format.

## Usage
For using the program simply run
```./msh```

Interactive help and commands are available using ```-h``` flag.
